## Install

```sh
deno add jsr:@nick/lz4
```

```sh
bunx jsr add @nick/lz4
```

```sh
pnpm dlx jsr add @nick/lz4
```

```sh
yarn dlx jsr add @nick/lz4
```

```sh
npx jsr add @nick/lz4
```

---

## Usage

```ts
import * as lz4 from "@nick/lz4";

// let's fetch a huge webassembly binary (~4MB)
const data = await fetch(
  "https://plugins.dprint.dev/typescript-0.94.0.wasm",
).then((response) => response.bytes());

console.assert(data.length === 4083340); // OK

const compressed = lz4.compress(data);
console.assert(compressed.length === 1644878); // OK

const decompressed = lz4.decompress(compressed);
console.assert(decompressed.length === data.length); // OK
console.assert(decompressed.every((v, i) => v === data[i])); // OK
```

### CDN

You can also use the package directly from a CDN, which is super useful for
running in a browser environment without needing to install anything.

#### Using [`esm.sh`] directly

```html
<script type="module">
  import * as lz4 from "https://esm.sh/jsr/@nick/lz4";
</script>
```

#### Using an [import map]

Leveraging an [import map] can help simplify your imports, allowing the same
code to be re-used across different environments. This is especially useful
for projects that may be using different package managers or module loaders.

```html
<script type="importmap">
  {
    "imports": {
      "@nick/lz4": "https://esm.sh/jsr/@nick/lz4"
    }
  }
</script>

<script type="module">
  import * as lz4 from "@nick/lz4";
</script>
```

> [!TIP]
>
> You can also specify the `"imports"` and `"scopes"` properties in a
> `deno.json` file, allowing you to share the same import map between
> browser and Deno environments.
>
> **[‚Üí Learn more about `deno.json`]**

## API

### `compress`

Compresses the input data using the LZ4 compression algorithm.

#### Signature

```ts ignore
function compress(data: Uint8Array): Uint8Array;
```

##### Params

**`data`** - The input data to compress, represented as a `Uint8Array`.

##### Return

The compressed data, also represented as a `Uint8Array`.

#### Example

Let's try compressing the inline WebAssembly file from this package! Silly,
I know, but it's an immutable example with a known size.

```ts
import { compress } from "@nick/lz4";

const data = await fetch("https://jsr.io/@nick/lz4@0.1.0/lib/lz4.js")
  .then((res) => res.bytes());

console.assert(data.length === 12012); // OK

const compressed = compress(data);

console.assert(compressed.length === 9459); // OK
```

---

### `decompress`

Decompresses the input data using the LZ4 decompression algorithm.

#### Signature

```ts ignore
function decompress(data: Uint8Array): Uint8Array;
```

##### Params

**`data`** - The compressed data to decompress, represented as a `Uint8Array`.

##### Return

The decompressed data, also represented as a `Uint8Array`.

#### Example

Continuing with the same example, let's ensure that the decompressed data
matches the original data passed to the compressor.

```ts
import { decompress } from "@nick/lz4";

const data = await fetch(
  "https://jsr.io/@nick/lz4@0.1.0/lib/lz4.js",
).then((response) => response.bytes());

const compressed = compress(data);
console.assert(compressed.length === 9459); // OK

const decompressed = decompress(compressed);
console.assert(decompressed.length === data.length); // OK

// now we check that every byte is the same between the two buffers.
// note that with larger files a check like this would be VERY expensive.
console.assert(decompressed.every((v, i) => v === data[i])); // OK
```

## Further Reading

### Acknowledgements

This package was inspired by the [`deno.land/x/lz4`] module by [Denosaurs].

### Motivation and Goals

Initially this package was created with some pretty straightforward (albeit
ambitious) goals in mind. I wanted to create a ultra-lightweight compression
utility that could be used in a variety of runtime environments without any
dependencies.

- [x] **Reduce** WASM binary size as much as possible - cut in _half_!
- [x] **Extend** compatibility to support **all** WebAssembly-friendly runtimes
- [x] **Enable** the `no_std` attribute, emancipating it from rust-std
- [x] **Switch** to [`lol_alloc`] for lightweight, jovial memory allocation
- [x] **Update** `lz4-compressor` and `wasm-bindgen` to the latest versions
- [x] **Publish** to [JSR], the spiritual successor to `deno.land/x`

### Why LZ4?

I've experimented with a few different compression algorithms,
and while LZ4 may not be the _most_ efficient, the small footprint and fast
compression and decompression times make it a great choice for many use cases.

#### LZ4 vs. Brotli

LZ4 is a great choice for scenarios where speed is more important than
compression ratio. If you need a higher compression ratio and are willing to
sacrifice some speed, you might want to consider using [Brotli] instead.

> [!TIP]
>
> If you're in the market for a fast brotli decompressor, check out
> [@nick/brotli] ([npm:debrotli]) for a blazing fast WebAssembly solution, and
> [@nick/brocha] ([npm:brocha]) for a pure TypeScript decompressor with speeds
> _almost_ as fast as its WebAssembly counterpart. `brocha` is a direct port to
> TypeScript from the original C++ [brotli] source code.
>
> **Disclaimer**: _I'm also the author of both of the aforementioned packages.
> Please forgive my shameless self-plug._ üôÉ
